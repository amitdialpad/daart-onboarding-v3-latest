# DAART Onboarding V3 - Conversational Builder

A Vue 3 prototype for conversational AI agent building using the Dialtone design system.

## Live Demo

🌐 **[View Live Demo](https://amitayre.github.io/daart-onboarding-v3/)**

## Overview

V3 introduces a conversational-first approach to building AI agents, replacing the workspace-based model with an AI-guided chat interface that walks users through agent creation step-by-step.

**Key Features:**
- Personalized suggested goals based on mined CC transcripts
- Conversational builder with milestone tracking
- In-conversation actions (tool connections, validation, testing)
- Two building modes: Step-by-step and "Do everything"
- Full agent lifecycle: Build → Test → Deploy → Monitor
- Built with Dialtone design system

## Design Constraints

**IMPORTANT:**
- **NO EMOJIS** - Do not use emojis anywhere in the project
- **Lo-Fi Approach** - Keep design minimal until Dialtone MCP is available
- **Dialtone CSS Only** - Using plain CSS classes (no Vue components due to compatibility)
- Focus on functionality first, polish later

## Tech Stack

- **Vue 3** - Composition API
- **Vite** - Build tool
- **Vue Router** - Navigation
- **Pinia** - State management
- **Dialtone** - Design system
  - `@dialpad/dialtone` - Core styles
  - `@dialpad/dialtone-vue` - Vue components
  - `@dialpad/dialtone-icons` - Icons

## Navigation Architecture

The application uses a dual-mode navigation system:

**During Onboarding (First-Time Users):**
- No left navigation sidebar
- Full-screen conversational builder
- Focus on step-by-step agent creation

**Post-Onboarding (Workspace Mode):**
- Persistent left navigation sidebar (Intercom-style)
- 240px sidebar with:
  - DAART branding
  - Agent name selector
  - Navigation items: Overview, Build, Test, Deploy, Monitor
  - Agent Studio & Knowledge (advanced features)
  - Help & Docs, Settings footer
- Triggers when agent reaches "ready to test" state
- Links become enabled based on agent status

### Known Issues:
- None currently - ready for EPD team review

**See PROGRESS.md for detailed session notes and technical decisions.**

## Design Reference

See `/V3_PLAN.md` for complete implementation plan and design vision.

Design source: Loom video from Sofia + PDF wireframes

## Dialtone MCP

✅ **Installed, Configured, and Verified Working**

The Dialtone MCP server is installed globally and configured for Claude Code:
```bash
npm install -g @dialpad/dialtone-mcp-server
claude mcp add dialtone --scope user dialtone-mcp-server
```

This enables Claude to query:
- **Components** - DtButton, DtInput, DtCard, etc. with props and usage
- **Design Tokens** - Colors, spacing, typography, borders
- **Utility Classes** - d-p24, d-m64, d-bar-circle, etc.
- **Icons** - Alert icons, navigation icons, etc.

### Important: CSS Import Setup

**You MUST import both base CSS and theme CSS for Dialtone to work:**

```javascript
// src/main.js
import '@dialpad/dialtone/css'              // Base styles
import '@dialpad/dialtone/css-default-theme' // Theme tokens (REQUIRED!)
```

The theme CSS provides all the CSS custom property values (`--dt-color-*`, `--dt-space-*`, etc.) that make the design system work.

## Agent Lifecycle Flow

1. **Starting Point** - User enters their agent goal
2. **Builder** - Conversational interface guides through 6 phases:
   - Phase 1: Agent Foundation & Tasks
   - Phase 2: Connections (Calendar, Video, CRM)
   - Phase 3: Safety & Guardrails
   - Phase 4: Validation & Refine
   - Phase 5: Additional Tasks (optional)
   - Phase 6: Test & Launch
3. **Ready State** - Navigation links unlock (Test, Deploy, Agent Studio, Knowledge)
4. **Testing** - Test agent in simulated environment
5. **Deployment** - Deploy to channels (Chat Widget, Email, Phone, Slack)
6. **Monitoring** - View performance metrics and conversations
7. **Agent Studio** - Advanced workflow editing (placeholder)
